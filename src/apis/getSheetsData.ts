  {
    question: "What is the Research branch?",
    answer:
      "The Research branch of ACM at UCSB provides opportunities for undergraduate students to get involved in cutting-edge research at various UCSB labs. Through the 'Research Connect' program, students can be directly matched with open lab positions. The branch also hosts research panels, offering students a chance to network one-on-one with researchers and gain valuable insights into the world of academic and industry research.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the Web Development branch?",
    answer:
      "The Web Development branch is a specialized division within our ACM chapter dedicated to web development. Our goal is to share expertise in full-stack development, including frameworks like React and Flask, with undergraduate students pursuing computer science. Watch for our upcoming website portfolio workshop and an exciting update to the former Coders SB project series!",
  },
  {
    question: "What happened to Coders SB?",
