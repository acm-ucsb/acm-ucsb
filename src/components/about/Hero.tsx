              ACM at UCSB is a student-run organization that aims to support
              students interested in Computer Science by fostering a community
              of individuals who seek to learn from each other. Specifically, we
              create a place for students to prepare for a career in CS through
              hands-on experience developing real-world projects; gain exposure
              to a wide range of career paths within technology; network with
              faculty, graduate students, and professionals; pursue competitive
              programming opportunities; and ultimately have fun following their
              passion.
