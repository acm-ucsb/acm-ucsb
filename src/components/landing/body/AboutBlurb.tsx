          ACM at UCSB is a student-run organization that aims to support
          students interested in Computer Science by fostering a community of
          individuals who seek to learn from each other. Specifically, we create
          a place for students to prepare for a career in CS through hands-on
          experience developing real-world projects; gain exposure to a wide
          range of career paths within technology; network with faculty,
          graduate students, and professionals; pursue competitive programming
          opportunities; and ultimately have fun following their passion.
